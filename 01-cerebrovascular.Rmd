[@aburahmaSocietyVascularSurgery2022]

## Presentation and Diagnosis

1.  **What is the definition of crescendo TIAs?**

    Frequent repetitive neurological attacks without complete resolution
    of the deficit between the episodes, producing the same deficit but
    no progressive deterioration in neurological function If a
    progressive deterioration then it is a stroke in evolution.

2.  **Who needs to be screened?**

    Only 15% of stroke victims have a warning TIA before a stroke so
    waiting until symptoms occur is not ideal. The purpose of carotid
    bifurcation imaging is to detect "stroke-prone" carotid bifurcation
    plaque and identify a high-risk patient likely to benefit from
    therapy designed to reduce stroke risk.

    The absence of a neck bruit does not exclude the possibility of a
    significant carotid bifurcation lesion - focal ipsilateral carotid
    bruits in symptomatic patients has a sensitivity of 63% and a
    specificity of 61% for high-grade carotid stenosis (range, 70%-99%).

    Screening of the general population is not indicated. Screening
    should be considered for patients with:

    -   Evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease
        regardless of age

    -   Patients aged >65 years with a history of one or more of the
        following atherosclerotic risk factors:

        -   CAD

        -   Smoking

        -   Hypercholesterolemia

    -   In general, the more risk factors present, the higher the yield
        of screening should be expected.

    -   The benefit of prophylactic treatment of high grade stenosis is
        estimated at a 1-2% stroke reduction risk per year.
        [@naylorWhyManagementAsymptomatic2015]

    -   Keep in mind that intervention (CEA/CAS) has only demonstrated a
        benefit in asymptomatic patient with life expectancy greater
        than 3 years. [@bulbuliaAsymptomaticCarotidSurgery2017;
        @halliday10yearStrokePrevention2010;
        @rosenfieldRandomizedTrialStent2016]

3.  **US findings that confirm disease**

    -   50-69% stenosis of ICA - Low sensitivity for 50-69% stenosis - a
        negative ultrasound in symptomatic patients necessitates
        additional imaging

        -   PSV 125-229 cm/sec
        -   EDV 40-100
        -   Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio 2-4

    -   70-99% stenosis of ICA

        -   PSV >/= 230 cm/sec

        -   EDV >100 (EDV > 140 cm/sec most sensitive for stenosis >80%)

        -   Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio > 4

    -   Velocity-based estimation of carotid artery stenosis may need to
        be adjusted in certain circumstances

        -   Higher velocities in women than in men

        -   Higher velocities in the presence of contralateral carotid
            artery occlusion.

    -   High carotid bifurcation, severe arterial tortuosity, extensive
        vascular calcification, and obesity may also reduce the accuracy
        of DUS imaging

4.  **Other Imaging Modalities**

    -   CTA

        -   Pro - fast, sub-millimeter spatial resolution, visualize
            surrounding structures

        -   Con - cost, contrast exposure

    -   MRA

        -   Pro - no contrast administered; analyze plaque morphology

        -   Con - Does not visualize calcium in plaque; overestimates
            the degree of stenosis (False positive for 50-69% to be read
            as >70%)

    -   Catheter-based digital subtraction imaging (DSA)

        -   Still considered by many the gold-standard imaging modality

        -   Reserved for individuals with conflicting less-invasive
            imaging or those considered for CAS

        -   Con - cost and risk of stroke

## Management

### **Optimal medical therapy**

**Hypertension**

-   Lowering blood pressure to a target \<140/90 mmHg by lifestyle
    interventions and anti-hypertensive treatment is recommended in
    individuals who have hypertension with asymptomatic carotid
    atherosclerosis or those with TIA or stroke after the hyper-acute
    period.

-   Each 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure among hypertensive
    patients decreases the risk for stroke by 33%. ( can we reference this?)

**Diabetes**

-   In diabetic patients glycaemic control to nearly normoglycemic levels (target hemoglobin
    A1C \<7%) is recommended to reduce
    microvascular complications and, with a lower evidence base,
    macrovascular complications other than stroke. (can we reference this?)

**Lipid abnormalities**

-   Risk of stroke decreased by >15% for every 10% reduction in serum
    LDL in patients with known coronary or other atherosclerosis. (reference) 

-   Statin agents are recommended targeting LDL of 100 mg/dL, for those
    with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease,
    and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very high-risk persons with multiple risk
    factors. (Ref) 

-   High dose statin therapy in patients with TIA/stroke reduce future
    rates of stroke or cardiovascular events but not overall mortality
    at 5 years. [@karamHighDoseAtorvastatinStroke2008]

**Smoking** - Efforts to encourage smoking cessation in these patients is paramount for risk reduction. Physician counseling is an important and effective
intervention that reduces smoking in patients by 10% to 20%. (Ref) 

**Antithrombotic therapy** - There is no evidence to suggest that
antiplatelet agents other than aspirin have improved benefit in
asymptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerosis. (ref) 

### **Carotid endarterectomy**

**Timing**

-   Recommendations on when to operate after a stroke

    -   Acute stroke with a fixed neurologic deficit of >6h duration -
        When the patient is medically stable, treatment in less than or
        equal to 2 weeks after the stroke is preferable.
        [@rothwellEndarterectomySymptomaticCarotid2004;
        @meershoekTimingCarotidIntervention2018]

    -   Consider urgent intervention in a medically stable patient with
        mild-moderate neurologic deficit, if there is a significant area
        of ischemic penumbra at risk for progression

    -   Stroke in evolution (fluctuating / evolving neuro deficit) or
        crescendo TIA (repetitive transient ischemia w improvement
        between events) - If neuro status is not stabilized by medical
        intervention consider urgent CEA

    -   CEA is preferred to CAS based on an increased embolic potential
        of carotid lesions that present in this fashion.
        [@rantnerEarlyEndarterectomyCarries2017]

    -   Management of acute stroke [@powers2018GuidelinesEarly2018]

        -   \<4.5hrs from onset of symptoms - tPA unless
            contraindication

            -   Age >80 and diabetes are contraindication to tPA after
                3hrs.

            -   Other contraindications - high BP, intracranial
                hemorrhage, recent stroke or head trauma, spine/brain
                surgery within 3mo, GI bleed within 21d

        -   \<6hr from onset of symptoms - catheter directed therapy

-   What is the only emergent indication for CEA?

    -   Crescendo TIAs or a stroke in evolution with a surgically
        correctable lesion that is identified

**Intraoperative Techniques**

-   General concepts

    -   Patch angioplasty or eversion endarterectomy are recommended
        rather than primary closure to reduce the early and late
        complications of CEA (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A).

-   Neuromonitoring/Shunting options during a carotid endarterectomy

    -   Local anesthesia with direct neuro monitoring - the patient is
        awake and moving to command throughout the case. Though improved
        neuromonitoring has not been shown to reduce MI rate with CEA

    -   Stump pressure Clamp the inflow and place butterfly attached to
        a-line tubing into the internal carotid If stump pressure is >
        40 mmHg can proceed, if \< 40 place shunt

    -   EEG Neuromonitoring - EEG tech places neuromonitoring, monitored
        by intraop tech and neurologist remotely, generally clamp ICA
        for 3 minutes before proceeding, if any deficits unclamp, await
        normalization of EEG then proceed

    -   Non-selective shunting - shunt all carotids

-   Techniques to reach internal carotid lesions that are high?

    -   Nasotracheal intubation will help extend the neck to reach
        higher lesions

    -   Divide posterior belly of digastric to reach high lesions with
        care to watch for glossopharyngeal

    -   Styloidectomy

    -   Mandible subluxation with assistance from ENT if previous
        techniques fail.

-   What is the best technique for a patient with a kinked internal
    carotid artery?

    -   Eversion carotid endarterectomy will allow you to reduce the
        redundancy

    -   Otherwise, no advantage has been shown between eversion or
        patch, both can be shunted

-   Discuss nerve injuries -- where you would encounter these and what
    deficit would be seen

    -   Hypoglossal Just above the bifurcation of the carotid artery
        Will see tongue deviation to the side of injury

    -   Glossopharyngeal High dissections under digastric Difficulty
        swallowing, aspiration risk, can be devastating

    -   Vagus Adjacent and lateral to carotid, injury occurs with
        carotid clamping, Hoarseness is noted as RLN is a branch off of
        vagus

    -   Marginal Mandibular (Off of facial nerve) Retraction at the
        angle of the jaw for high dissections Leads to the corner of lip
        drooping, can be confused with a neuro deficit following the
        case

**Postoperative Complications**

-   What to do if neuro deficits following your carotid endarterectomy

    -   If in OR -- perform duplex, if normal open wound and shoot
        cerebral angiogram

    -   If in Recovery or on the floor -- many would consider CTA first
        vs duplex to look for thrombosis

-   Risk factors and how to manage hyperperfusion syndrome?

    -   Defined as an ipsilateral headache, hypertension, seizures, and
        focal neurological deficits can present 2-3 days out from
        surgery

    -   Patients with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for
        hyperperfusion syndrome, clinical practice guidelines by SVS
        recommend strict BP control following CEA, maintain a pressure
        less than 140/80

-   High risk groups

    -   ESRD patients have higher rates of perioperative stroke, but
        also have higher rates of stroke if not revascularized.
        [@klarinPerioperativeLongtermImpact2016]

**Long term complications and follow up**

-   Recommend f/u US at \</=30 days. >/= 50% stenosis requires further
    imaging.

-   Contralateral stenosis

    -   The risk of progression for moderate stenosis at the initial
        surveillance to severe stenosis can be as high as five times

    -   Requires post-operative surveillance.

### Carotid Artery Stenting

-   In patients aged >70 undergoing CAS the risk of stroke was the
    highest, presumably due to calcific disease in the arch

    -   Lesion-specific characteristics are thought to increase the risk
        of cerebral vascular events after CAS and include a "soft"
        lipid-rich plaque identified on noninvasive imaging, extensive
        (15 mm or more) disease, a pre-occlusive lesion, and
        circumferential heavy calcification

    -   This can be reduced, but not eliminated, by using flow-reversal
        embolic protection rather than distal filter protection

-   Limited data on CAS in asymptomatic patients - currently is not
    supported by guidelines or considered reimbursable

-   Consider CAS in symptomatic patients with >50% stenosis who are poor
    candidates for CEA due to severe uncorrectable medical comorbidities
    and/or anatomic considerations

    -   Ipsilateral neck dissection or XRT - equivalent periprocedural
        stroke rate to CEA, but increased later stroke rate. CEA higher
        rates of cranial nerve damage (9%).
        [@giannopoulosRevascularizationRadiationinducedCarotid2018]

    -   Contralateral vocal cord paralysis

    -   Lesions that extend proximally to the clavicle or distal to C2

-   Transfemoral Approach vs Transcarotid approach

    -   ROADSTER Trial - single arm study with flow reversal for
        cerebral protection. Suggest lower rates of post-op stroke

-   Post-op follow up - Dual-platelet therapy should be continued for 1
    month after the procedure, and aspirin should be continued
    indefinitely

    -   In stent restenosis (>50%) - repeat angioplasty or stent have
        low incidence of periprocedural stroke but failed to improve
        long term stroke/death/MI or patency rates.
        [@chungPercutaneousInterventionCarotid2016a]

### Management of uncommon disease presentations

-   Occluded Carotid What to do for occluded carotid?

    -   Leave it alone

-   What if occluded carotid is still causing TIAs?

    -   External carotid endarterectomy and ligation of internal

    -   The addition of oral anticoagulation is likely to reduce the
        rate of recurrent CVA

-   What if the patient has severe vertebrobasilar insufficiency and
    carotid artery disease?

    -   Should undergo carotid revascularization first to improve flow
    -   Vertebrobasilar insufficiency characterized by dizziness,
        ataxia, nausea, vertigo and bilateral weakness.
        [@limanetoPathophysiologyDiagnosisVertebrobasilar2017]

-   What about tandem lesions in the carotid in a symptomatic patient,
    carotid bulb and carotid siphon lesion (high ICA)? How should you
    treat this?

    -   Treat carotid bulb first, likely the embolic source

-   Carotid artery dissection

    -   Patients with carotid dissection should be initially treated
        with antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet agents or
        anticoagulation) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C).

    -   Indications for endovascular treatment of carotid artery
        dissection [@cohenSinglecenterExperienceEndovascular2012;
        @markusAntiplateletTherapyVs2019a;
        @phamEndovascularStentingExtracranial2011]

        -   Ongoing symptoms on best medical therapy

        -   Contraindication to antithrombotics

        -   Pseudoaneurysm

-   Simultaneous coronary and carotid disease

    -   Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis will benefit from CEA
        before or concomitant with CABG. The timing of the intervention
        depends on the clinical presentation and institutional
        experience (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B).

    -   Patients with severe bilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis,
        including stenosis and contralateral occlusion, should be
        considered for CEA before or concomitant with CABG (GRADE 2,
        Level of Evidence B)

    -   Patients undergoing simultaneous CEA/CABG demonstrate highest
        mortality. [@naylorSystematicReviewOutcomes2003]

## Prospective Trials - MUST READS

1.  Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS)

    -   Compared medical management with CEA in asymptomatic patients
        with > 60% stenosis

    -   5-year stroke and death rate was 5.1% vs 11%

    -   In women, the benefit of CEA was not as certain as 5y stroke and
        death rates were 7.3% vs. 8.7%

    -   This was pre statin and clopidogrel era

2.  North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET)
    [@northamericansymptomaticcarotidendarterectomytrialcollaboratorsBeneficialEffectCarotid1991]

    -   Compared medical management vs CEA for symptomatic patients with
        moderate (50-69%) and severe stenosis (>70%)

    -   Only moderate impact for patients with moderate stenosis
        (50-69%)

    -   Symptomatic patients with >70 % stenosis benefited from CEA, at
        18 months 7% major stroke in surgical arm, and a 24% stroke rate
        in medical arm. 29% reduction in 5-year risk of stroke or death

        -   Patients with severe >70% stenosis had such a dramatic
            effect the trial was stopped early for this subset and all
            referred for endarterectomy

    -   No benefit is shown in symptomatic patients with \< 50% stenosis

    -   European studies have shown similar results

        -   ACST = ACAS

        -   ECST = NASCET.

3.  Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial
    (CREST)

    -   Compared CEA vs. CAS in both symptomatic and asymptomatic
        patients.

    -   Composite endpoint of 30-day stroke, MI, death equivalent
        between CEA and CAS

    -   CAS had a significantly higher incidence of stroke and death
        than CEA and CEA higher incidence of MI

        -   Follow up at 10 years demonstrated no difference in
            composite stroke/MI/death but increased rate of stroke/death
            in stented patients likely attributable to increased
            periprocedural stroke. [@brottLongTermResultsStenting2016b]

    -   Subanalyses identified that older patients (>70y) had better
        outcomes after CEA than CAS, the QOL impact of stroke was more
        significant than that of MI, and anatomic characteristics of
        carotid lesions (longer, sequential, remote) were predictive of
        increased stroke and death after CAS

    -   Unfortunately, this study provides a benchmark to strive for,
        but no other large trials have achieved these results.

4.  ROADSTER

    -   Single arm feasibility trial of transcarotid carotid stenting

    -   The results of the ROADSTER trial demonstrate that the use of
        the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is safe and effective at preventing
        stroke during CAS. The overall stroke rate of 1.4% is the lowest
        reported to date for any prospective, multicenter clinical trial
        of CAS.

5.  Trials to look out for in the next few years

    -   CREST-2 - multicenter, randomized controlled trial is underway
        that is evaluating revascularization against modern intensive
        medical management

    -   ACT-1 and ACST-2- the role of intervention in asymptomatic
        patients, designed to compare the early and long-term results of
        CEA vs CAS and best medical management

    -   ROADSTER-2 - TCAR
