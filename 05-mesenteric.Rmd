## Introduction 

Mesenteric vascular disease can be broken down into three disease states.
All of which will be covered in this chapter. 

1. Arterial 
2. Venous 
3. Mesenteric Syndrome 

## Anatomy 

### Arterial Supply 
Mesenteric collatorals are important for protecting against mesenteric
ischemia. The gastroduodenal and pacreaticoduodenal arteries connect the
celiac and SMA. The meandering artery (arc of riolan) and marginal
artery of Drummond connect IMA and SMA. Hemorrhoidal branches connect
internal iliacs and IMA. [@chandraChronicMesentericIschemia2010;
@vangulikAnastomosisRiolanRevisited2005]

### Venous Drainage 

It all ends up in the portal vien 

## Acute Mesenteric Ischemia

### Presentation and diagnosis

**Can you tell me about the classic presentation and approach to
patients presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia?**

These patients present with the sudden onset of abdominal pain. Nausea,
vomiting, distention, and diarrhea (possibly bloody, described as
"sudden and forceful evacuation") are the common symptoms. Pain out of
proportion is the classic buzzword, and can be hidden on multiple choice
tests with a pain score of 10/10 with only mild abdominal tenderness on
physical exam.

Etiology most often from acute embolism (40-50%), which is often
secondary to cardiac source (atrial fibrillation or recent
MI).[@wyersmarkcandmartin133AcuteMesenteric2019]

Vitals typically normal, possible tachycardia.

Lab evaluation typically unremarkable. Leukocytosis, hemoconcentration,
and acidosis (high anion gap) all are frequently found, but the absence
of these definitely does **not** rule out acute mesenteric ischemia.

D-dimer has been proposed as a reasonable rule-out test for acute
mesenteric ischemia.

**How about radiology studies?**

[Plain film:]{.underline}

Frequently normal, may show ileus in the early stages. In late stage
acute mesenteric ischemia, findings on plain film can include bowel wall
edema (thumbprinting) or pneumatosis.

[CT angio:]{.underline}

Probably represents the most common diagnostic modality to diagnose
acute mesenteric ischemia. CTA has the advantages of speed,
availability, and noninvasiveness when compared to conventional
angiography, and also allows for some assessment of the degree of bowel
involvement. 

Preferentially, a "negative" oral contrast agent would help prevent oral
contrast from causing artifact or obscuring evaluation of the vessels,
although the availability of these agents may limit their use.

**How about mesenteric duplex (vascular lab studies)?**

Mesenteric duplex has the advantage of being able to see the velocity of
flow across a stenosis, giving you a good method of quantifying the
significance of a stenosis. However, bowel gas often limits the acoustic
windows for visualizing the mesenteric arteries, and so we usually will
have patients fast for several hours before a study. Also, duplex is
more sensitive for proximal disease rather than distal mesenteric
involvement. For these reasons, mesenteric duplex is considered the gold
standard for evaluating chronic mesenteric ischemia, but has no real
role in the evaluation of acute mesenteric ischemia. Can you imagine,
having a tech mash a transducer into a patient with acute abdominal
pain?[!]{.underline} 

### Management

**What's your approach to the initial management of the patient?**

1.  [Resuscitation]{.underline}. Fluids, fluids, fluids. These patients
    are really volume down, and are headed towards a profound
    distributive shock that will be worsened by your eventual plan for
    revascularization (think ischemia-reperfusion injury). Also look for
    electrolyte imbalances and correct those early.

2.  [Antibiotics]{.underline}. These patients are not usually septic on
    initial presentation, but are at high-risk, so broad-spectrum
    antibiotics with gut coverage (Gram negative and anaerobes) are
    standard of care.

3.  [Heparin]{.underline}. In the absence of a clinical
    contraindication, these patients should be systemically heparinized,
    with a bolus, as soon as the diagnosis is made. 

**Which blood vessel does acute mesenteric ischemia typically involve?**

The SMA. This makes sense if you think of each mesenteric distribution.
The celiac distribution has organs that have redundant blood supply
(like liver and stomach). The IMA is frequently occluded in patients
with AAA, but the patients are rarely ever symptomatic due to collateral
flow. The hypogastrics (which ARE mesenteric vessels, especially in the
situation of an occluded IMA) principally supply the rectum from a
mesenteric standpoint.

For embolic pathology, the acute angle of the SMA seems to predispose it
to capture emboli from above, but this is more theoretical than proven.
The embolism is often lodged distal to middle colic
vessel.[@wyersmarkcandmartin133AcuteMesenteric2019;
@kazmersOperativeManagementAcute1998]

**Tell me about the two main pathologies, and how they would differ in
terms of the anatomy and operative findings.**

So the two most common etiologies of acute mesenteric ischemia are
embolism and thrombosis. 

Embolism is the more common, where preexisting thrombus (think atrial
fibrillation, mural thrombus from thoracic aneurysm, etc.) or plaques
from atherosclerotic disease break off and lodge in the SMA. The classic
operative finding is that an embolism lodges just distal to the middle
colic artery, where there is a significant caliber change in the SMA.
This is distal to the first few jejunal branches off of the SMA, leading
to the classic sparing of the proximal jejunum and transverse colon. In
other words, the mid to distal jejunum and all of the ileum will be
ischemic, but other areas of the SMA territory are spared.
Atherosclerotic debris is typically smaller, and results in smaller,
more patchy areas of ischemia.

Thrombosis occurs primarily as a plaque rupture of preexisting
atherosclerotic disease, resulting in acute thrombosis at the site of
the disease. Thus the patients will often present with an
acute-on-chronic symptomatology, having classic symptoms of postprandial
abdominal pain, food fear, and weight loss, but with a sudden onset of
severe symptoms. This frequently allows for the development of
mesenteric collaterals, which may make the onset of acute symptoms more
insidious than for embolic pathology. In the majority of situations, the
atherosclerotic disease is most severe right at the origin (consistent
with what we know about shear stress and branch points in blood
vessels). This means that when the plaque ruptures, the entirety of the
SMA occludes, leading to ischemia of the entire territory, as opposed to
the jejunal-sparing distribution seen in embolic disease.

**Describe the operative steps to getting exposure of the supraceliac
aorta (or the celiac artery).**

1.  Divide triangular ligament to mobilize left lobe of liver

2.  Divide gastrohepatic ligament to enter the lesser sac 

3.  Retract liver to right with a self-retaining retractor

4.  Push esophagus left (use NGT to assist with identification)

5.  Divide peritoneum overlying crura to identify celiac vessels

6.  Typically trace common hepatic artery backwards to identify celiac
    artery

    -   Watch out for the left gastric vein as it crosses the celiac
        artery as it drains the lesser curve of the stomach into the
        portal vein.

    -   About half of the time, the phrenic artery takes an origin from
        the celiac artery and must be controlled during exposure.

7.  To expose the supraceliac aorta, divide the median arcuate ligament
    and separate the left and right crura from each other.

**So through this kind of exposure, what mesenteric vessels do you get
access to?**

You can trace most of the proximal celiac distribution right at the
origin, and through this exposure you get access to the origin of the
SMA if you mobilize the superior border of the pancreas. The neck of the
pancreas and the splenic vein cross the anterior of the SMA, obscuring
the rest of the mid and distal SMA from the superior approach.

**How about getting to the rest of the SMA?**

There are a couple of places you can get exposure to the SMA. 

Most commonly you'll hear it described at "root of the mesentery."
Specifically, lifting up the transverse colon will stretch out its
mesentery (i.e. transverse mesocolon). At the bottom, or "root" of the
transverse mesocolon, a transverse incision is made. If the middle colic
artery is palpable in the mesocolon, the incision can be made around it,
and you can trace the middle colic backwards to the SMA. Usually you'll
find the SMV first, and the SMA will be just to the left of it. Be sure
to identify and preserve small jejunal branches during the dissection.
If needed, careful dissection superiorly, going behind the inferior
border of the pancreas can get a little more proximal exposure.
Embolectomy through a transverse arteriotomy in the SMA is the best
approach.[@wyersmarkcandmartin2019;
@kazmersOperativeManagementAcute1998]

Alternatively, you can get to the SMA from a lateral approach,
specifically from the left side. Begin by dividing the ligament of
Treitz and mobilizing the 4th portion of the duodenum. The SMA is found
in the tissues just cephalad to the duodenum. You can also improve your
proximal exposure if needed by retracting the inferior border of the
pancreas cephalad to the level of the left renal vein.

Other options include a retroperitoneal exposure, like you were
preparing to treat a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. Additionally, the more
distal SMA can just be identified in the small bowel mesentery.

**So for the operative strategy for acute mesenteric ischemia, tell me
about the general approach to the patient.**

1.  [Resect frankly necrotic bowel and contain gross
    spillage]{.underline}. Once you revascularize the bowel,
    compromised-appearing bowel may improve and not need immediate
    resection. Thus the first step is only damage control, to remove
    anything completely unsalvageable that is making the patient sick,
    or anything causing gross contamination of the operative field. The
    key is you're not doing anything definitive with the bowel as your
    first step.

2.  [Revascularization]{.underline}. SMA embolectomy is the initial
    management of choice for embolic disease. Thrombotic disease, on the
    other hand, may be more challenging to treat by embolectomy alone,
    and frequently are treated with a bypass. (More to come on these
    procedures).

3.  [Re-assess bowel viability]{.underline}. Clinical status permitting,
    20-30 minutes should be taken to fully assess the results of the
    revascularization before proceeding with resection. Perfusion can be
    assessed by many methods, including clinically, by Doppler, pulse
    oximetry (a.k.a. photoplethysmography), fluorescein fluorescence,
    etc. The take home is to give the bowel enough time to be perfused
    before going ahead with resection.

4.  [Proceed with temporizing or definitive bowel repair]{.underline}.
    Resection, leaving in discontinuity, primary anastomosis, diversion,
    etc. All of these are options on the table, but the key here is that
    all of the previous steps occur before addressing the bowel. 

5.  [Consider second-look laparotomy.]{.underline} Many times, bowel may
    look questionable even after revascularization and thorough
    re-assessment. To preserve the most bowel length, it may be
    reasonable to leave borderline bowel alone at the index operation
    and do a "second look" to fully reassess the bowel, especially after
    the patient has benefitted from aggressive resuscitation in the ICU.

Endovascular approaches to acute mesenteric ischemia have been described
but data is limited. Exploratory laparotomy and embolectomy should be
preferred management.[@wyersmarkcandmartin2019]

**Let's talk a little about the steps for an SMA embolectomy.**

Typically, you'll expose at the root of the transverse mesocolon. After
obtaining proximal and distal control, an arteriotomy is made, and
embolectomy can be performed by passing Fogarty catheters in both a
retrograde and antegrade fashion. The arteriotomy can be made
transversely for an embolectomy, and thus could be closed primarily. A
longitudinal arteriotomy may be advisable if you have a high suspicion
that you'll need to do a bypass, and if not, may be closed with vein
patch angioplasty (remember that the field is contaminated or dirty in
many situations).

**So if I'm gonna do a bypass, what are my options for conduit?**

Yeah, so again, because the field is frequently contaminated or dirty, a
good conduit is saphenous, followed by femoral vein. Thus every patient
undergoing surgery for acute mesenteric ischemia should have both legs
prepped out in the field. Prosthetic conduit has the advantages of being
more resistant to kinking (externally reinforced), likely better patency
than vein (although data are a little mixed), but in the situation of
gross contamination may be less preferred than vein. Other less common
options include cryo-preserved cadaveric homograft, or rifampin-soaked
prosthetic.

**And what are some of my options for constructing a bypass?**

[Short retrograde aorto-SMA bypass:]{.underline}

This bypass takes is origin off of the aorta just below the SMA,
anastomosing typically end-side onto the SMA just below its origin in
order to bypass ostial or very proximal disease. This is a relatively
quick bypass, with only one field of dissection directly from the aorta
below the SMA onto the proximal-mid SMA. The length of the bypass is
very short, limiting concerns with kinking or twisting of the bypass.
However, this may not always be feasible, as SMA disease often coexists
with significant aortic disease. Additionally, the other bypasses
described have better reported patency.

[Long retrograde R iliac-SMA bypass ("C-loop"):]{.underline}

This bypass originates from the right common iliac artery, which
presents a number of distinct advantages over an aorto-mesenteric
bypass. First, using the iliacs avoids the hemodynamic consequences of
an aortic cross-clamp, which may be contraindicated depending on your
patient's medical condition. Second, you can avoid showering, causing
dissection, or otherwise injuring your clamp sites if you have
significant disease in the mesenteric segment of the aorta, which is
common in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia. The graft should be
tunneled in a gentle C-loop towards the SMA to avoid kinging or
twisting. The proximal anastomosis is performed end-side on the iliac
artery, and the distal can be performed either end-end or end-side
depending on the anatomy of the disease. Especially when using
prosthetic in a contaminated field, you can consider taking an omental
flap to wrap or cover the prosthetic.

[Antegrade supraceliac aorta-SMA bypass:]{.underline}

This bypass originates from the supraceliac aorta. If revascularization
of both celiac and SMA is planned, a bifurcated graft can be selected. A
side-biting aortic clamp can be used to mitigate the hemodynamic effect
of an aortic cross-clamp. The tunnel to the SMA is created with gentle
finger dissection in a retropancreatic plane, taking care to avoid
injury to the SMV.

**What other options have been described for treatment of acute
mesenteric ischemia?**

[Retrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS)]{.underline}

So ROMS is a hybrid procedure involving an upper midline laparotomy that
is used to evaluate the bowel. Through this incision, SMA exposure is
obtained just as in a traditional open fashion at the root of the
mesentery. The mid-SMA is then punctured under direct vision, and the
area of disease is attempted to be treated from a retrograde approach
back into the aorta. If bowel ischemia is found, the upper midline is
easily lengthened into a traditional vertical laparotomy incision.

[Endovascular treatment (percutaneous thrombectomy / thrombolysis /
pharmacomechanical thrombectomy)]{.underline}

Some authors have described completely endovascular approaches to
treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia. However, the major limitation is
the inability to assess the bowel. These patients are frequently those
who are deemed to be lower-risk for frank bowel ischemia or perforation,
but the rates of laparotomy and bowel resection after these treatments
have been described at over 20%. Probably not your first answer for oral
boards.

### Other Etiologies

**What are some other, more rare etiologies of acute mesenteric
ischemia?**

Embolism is the most common etiology of acute mesenteric ischemia
(40-50%), and thrombotic etiology composes another quarter to a third of
these populations. The other two etiologies to consider are
non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia and mesenteric venous thrombosis.

**Perfect, so how does a non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (or NOMI)
patient differ from what we've been talking about?**

So NOMI patients typically do not have a focal lesion like you see with
embolism or thrombosis. What happens to these patients is that
classically they're pretty sick patients with some predisposing factors,
most commonly ESRD. On top of that, there was some clear inciting
hemodynamic event causing sustained hypotension, such as recently
getting a session of hemodialysis or undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.
The presentation is more indolent and less obvious than embolic or
thrombotic acute mesenteric ischemia, and the imaging findings are more
consistent with a diffuse vasospasm and hypovolemia picture.

Treatment is primarily conservative, with the emphasis on resuscitation
and addressing whatever the underlying etiology is. Adjuncts to this
include placement of infusion catheters into the affected vessel with
infusions of vasodilators (most commonly papaverine at 30-60mg/hr) or
prostaglandin [@wyersmarkcandmartin133AcuteMesenteric2019;
@trompeterNonocclusiveMesentericIschemia2002] NOMI with portal venous
gas, pneumatosis and free air often indicate need for laparotomy.

**How about mesenteric venous thrombosis?**

This is the most rare and most difficult to diagnose. They have a very
slow course, frequently with a lot of other workup already done. There's
a wide variety of causes that have been reported, and any of the things
that contribute to Virchow's triad have been reported (thrombophilia
from coagulopathy or malignancy, venous stasis from abdominal
hypertension or obesity, direct injury from trauma, surgery, or
inflammation). The diagnostic test of choice is a CT with portal vein
contrast, which most commonly identifies thrombosis in the superior
mesenteric vein (but can also involve the IMV, portal vein, or splenic
vein). The treatment of choice is therapeutic
anticoagulation.[@acosta2019]

## Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia

### Presentation and Diagnosis

**How does chronic mesenteric ischemia differ in its presentation?**

Chronic mesenteric ischemia is characterised by post-prandial abdominal
pain, typically 30-60 minutes after eating (think after gastric emptying
time). This pain is usually severe, crampy, and resolves after minutes
to hours of time. The pain leads to food fear and
eventual [unintentional]{.underline} weight loss.

The clinical presentation here is key. Chronic mesenteric ischemia is
pretty unlikely in patients who do not have this constellation of
clinical symptoms, and it's really common for patients to be referred
with imaging findings of elevated mesenteric velocities on duplex who
have none of the clinical findings, and thus do not benefit from any
intervention.

**What are the duplex criteria for chronic mesenteric ischemia?**

Yeah, so really the two vessels we're concerned with here are the celiac
artery and the SMA. It's pretty rare that stenosis of the IMA results in
clinically significant ischemia, and also pretty rare that isolated
disease of either the celiac or the SMA would be enough to cause
significant symptoms. Typically you see the classic symptomatology of
chronic mesenteric ischemia in patients with occlusive disease in both
the celiac and the SMA.

The key numbers to remember here are peak systolic velocities (that's
PSV) of 200 cm/s for the celiac artery, and 275 cm/s for the SMA. These
correspond to a stenosis of at least 70%. Remember,
the **superior** mesenteric artery has **higher** velocity criteria, in
case you forget. These classic numbers come from a study done in 1993,
and many other studies have demonstrated other thresholds. Make sure to
check with your friendly neighborhood vascular technician to see what
the thresholds in your local lab are!

In addition to the PSV, you can also use the end diastolic velocity
(EDV) to predict stenosis. For the EDV values in the celiac and the SMA,
think approximately 50 cm/s predicts a stenosis of 50% (easy to
remember, **50-50**). This is known as Bowersox criteria, and is
actually \>45, but 50 is easier to
remember.[@bowersoxDuplexUltrasonographyDiagnosis1991]

You can also predict a higher degree of stenosis with EDV values. This
is easy for the SMA, where an EDV of 70 cm/s predicts a stenosis of 70%
(**70-70**). For the celiac, it's a bit higher, where an EDV of 100 cm/s
predicts that same 70% stenosis.

So to review the numbers: [@monetaDuplexUltrasoundCriteria1991;
@monetaMesentericDuplexScanning1993; @zwolakMesentericCeliacDuplex1998]

-   PSVs: 200 in the celiac or 275 in the SMA gives you 70% stenosis

-   EDVs: 50s in the celiac or 50s in the SMA gives you 50% stenosis

-   EDV #2: 100 in the celiac, or 70 in the SMA gives you 70% stenosis.

Final thought. When the celiac artery is severely narrowed or occluded,
often you'll have retrograde flow coming from the SMA via collaterals
(these are your pancreaticoduodenal arcades via the GDA). You can see
this as backwards flow in the common hepatic artery, and this has 100%
specificity for disease in the celiac
artery.[@warnckeSuperiorMesentericArtery2019]

### Management

**What's next in the approach to these patients?**

Frequently they're going to get some kind of axial imaging, either CTA
or MRA, to help plan for their revascularization, although this isn't
strictly necessary. Often endovascular approaches are the mainstay of
treatment. Remember that the angle of the SMA frequently favors a
brachial approach, although you can also engage the SMA from a femoral
approach with preformed catheters (think Sos, Cobra, etc) or steerable
sheaths. Remember to watch out for median nerve compression from
brachial sheath hematomas if you've opted for a percutaneous brachial
approach, with a low threshold to evacuate the hematoma and perform
median nerve decompression if the patient develops and symptoms in the
median nerve distribution postoperatively. Also remember that a brachial
sheath hematoma will not be easily palpable or visible at the skin
level, so the neurologic exam postoperatively is key.

Single vessel SMA revascularization is widely accepted for chronic
mesenteric ischemia without necessarily needing to revascularize the
celiac axis. [@oderich132ChronicMesenteric2019;
@foleyRevascularizationSuperiorMesenteric2000]

**Any other technical tips for endo intervention on the mesenterics?**

The best view for diagnostic angiography in mesenteric ischemia is the
lateral view.

Most often balloon-expandable stents are selected for the mesenteric
circulation. The precision of deployment and the increased hoop strength
of a balloon expandable stent make them more favorable here over the
radial force of a self-expanding stent. You can also flare the proximal
end of a balloon-expandable stent into the aorta, making sure that
you've really treated any ostial disease. Some authors advocate for use
of embolic protection devices to prevent distal embolism, and other
authors also advocate for the use of covered stents for the mesenteric
circulation due to better patency.[@oderichComparisonCoveredStents2013;
@oderich132ChronicMesenteric2019]

**How about open revascularization?**

In most centers, up to 80% of CMI is treated endovascularly. Open is
often reserved for those that fail endovascular
therapy.[@oderichOpenSurgicalTreatment2010;
@oderich132ChronicMesenteric2019]

So we talked a lot about open revascularization earlier in the acute
mesenteric ischemia segment. The techniques are broadly similar, with
the exception that often for chronic mesenteric ischemia, frequently
you'll be planning to revascularize both the celiac and the SMA. The
approach for this is with a bifurcated graft from the supraceliac aorta,
taking one limb down to the celiac artery, and the other limb tunneled
in a retropancreatic fashion to the mid-SMA. Remember that this approach
requires a supraceliac aortic cross clamp, which your patient may not be
able to tolerate. But single revascularization of SMA is often
acceptable with appropriate collaterals. Taking a retrograde bypass off
of the common iliac artery as we previously described may be a better
option for patients with significant comorbidities. A further option
that completely avoids a bypass is to go right for a trapdoor
endarterectomy of the celiac artery and the SMA, allowing you to address
coral reef or proximal/ostial disease (such as flush occlusions) that
are difficult to treat endovascularly. 

## Mesenteric Aneurysms

### SMA Aneurysm

If symptomatic, most SMA aneurysms are mycotic in nature and require
treatment. Treat with resection and saphenous vein interposition and 6
weeks antibiotic therapy based on intraoperative
cultures.[@leeInfectedMycoticAneurysms2008]

Asymptomatic aneurysms can be observed up to
2.5cm.[@kwong85SplanchnicArtery; @stoneSuperiorMesentericArtery2002]

### Splenic Aneurysm

Post splenic aneurysm embolization, L flank pain in stable patients
likely represents splenic infarction. Treat with hydration and
analgesia. Rates are lower in stented
patients.[@kwong85SplanchnicArtery;
@piffarettiSplenicArteryAneurysms2007;
@zhuEndovascularSurgicalManagement2019]

Splenic artery embolization also an effective way to treat
thrombocytopenia, particularly chemo induced, when splenectomy is too
high risk.[@bhatia2015]

## Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS)

**Can you tell me about median arcuate ligament syndrome and how that
differs from chronic mesenteric ischemia?**

Sure, so median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), which has many names
(Dunbar syndrome, celiac axis compression syndrome, etc.) is a somewhat
controversial entity that occurs when repeated compression of the celiac
artery occurs against the median arcuate ligament during respiratory
variation. The thing you want to visualize here is that during full
exhalation, the lungs are completely emptied, and the diaphragm moves up
at a sharper angle. This angulation kinks off the celiac artery more
severely, so velocities in **exhalation** are **higher** in MALS.
However, these findings are common in asymptomatic patients, and so just
like chronic mesenteric ischemia, the clinical presentation is key.
They'll have a similar presentation as chronic mesenteric ischemia
patients, with post-prandial pain, food fear, and weight loss, but often
the symptomatology is a little more indolent in these patients. Because
of this, these patients have frequently gotten the million dollar workup
for nonspecific GI pain. Duplex ultrasound of shows celiac PSV \>200 and
EDV \>50, normalizes during deep inspiration, and post-stenotic spectral
broadening.[@zwolakMesentericCeliacDuplex1998]

The treatment of choice for suspected MALS is a laparoscopic median
arcuate ligament release, frequently performed by a MIS/foregut surgeon.
A key point here is that you don't want to be fooled into putting a
stent in these patients before they've gotten their median arcuate
ligament release, because the dynamic motion of the diaphragm is likely
to crimp or bend the stent if that hasn't been treated yet. It may be
that some patients benefit from endovascular treatment after release,
though, as some think that the chronic damage from MALS can result in
intimal damage/scarring that persists even after the extrinsic
compression is treated by the median arcuate ligament release.

## SMA Syndrome

**What is SMA syndrome?**

So SMA syndrome, also called Wilkie's Syndrome is a rare entity where
the 3rd portion of the duodenum gets compressed between the SMA and the
aorta, causing a functional gastric outlet obstruction. Patients are
typically emaciated, having lost a significant amount of weight before
their symptom onset. What's happened is they've lost the retroperitoneal
fat pat that normally surrounds the SMA, and so the angle between the
SMA and the aorta becomes more acute, pinching off the duodenum.

Classic findings in fluoroscopic swallow in SMA syndrome are delayed
gastric emptying, a dilated duodenum, to and fro peristalsis in the
proximal duodenum and cutoff in the third portion. EGD can show
pulsation in the 3rd portion of the
duodenum.[@warnckeSuperiorMesentericArtery2019]

The treatment of choice here is enteral feeding with a nasojejunal tube
or other surgically placed tube and TPN, because what really will help
them here is weight gain. GJ bypass or duodenal mobilization is
sometimes needed for treatment, but is controversial. It's not really a
mesenteric vascular disease, but it sometimes shows up on exams as a
related entity.[@welschRecallingSuperiorMesenteric2007;
@merrettSuperiorMesentericArtery2009]

## Uterine Fibroids

Symptomatic uterine fibroids are now often treated with uterine artery
embolization. Many patients require bilateral uterine artery
embolization (UAE), but may only need unilateral if blood supply is
unilateral. Infarcted tissue can be expelled or become infected even
years after initial embolization.
[@stepniakUterineArteryEmbolization2018]
